## Download and Usage
To use this program you can download this package from Github and run the following command after you are under the directory of `apriori-fast`:

		python apriori_dhp.py T10I4D100K.dat 500 output.txt 

The first argument can be any input file. The second argument is the minimum support for target frequent data patterns. The third argument is the name of any output file.
